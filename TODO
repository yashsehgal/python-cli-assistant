THIS IS THE TODO LIST OF FEATURES WE WILL BE ADDING IN THE CLI-APPLICATION

- Create an interactive cli-interface for the user to operate the application
- Use Local Storage/File Systems to store user-related data such as username, 
  github_profile, bio and other features which will be implemented further.

- Create a System which can be used to perform various git-related operations 
  on the projects/folders/repositories which are being added in the 
  system by the user.
